# SQL_Music_Project

Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree Project

In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.

You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer your question. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question.
